## Key Analysis Areas
Survival Patterns: Examination of factors related to passenger survival rates

Demographic Analysis: Study of passenger age distribution, gender composition, and travel class

Socioeconomic Factors: Investigation of fare structures and their correlations with other variables

Family Relationships: Analysis of family size and composition among passengers

## Privacy & Ethical Considerations
This analysis uses historical, publicly available data for educational purposes

All passenger information is from historical records and publicly shared for research/educational use

No personally identifiable information is created or inferred beyond the original dataset

Analysis focuses on aggregate patterns rather than individual passenger details

## Technical Implementation
Data Processing
Proper indexing and data structure optimisation

Appropriate data type assignments for performance

Data cleaning and validation procedures

Preparation for visualisation and further analysis

## Visualisation Preparation
The analysis includes data aggregation and processing suitable for creating visualisations in **Google Looker Studio**, focusing on:

Demographic distributions and patterns

Comparative survival analysis across different passenger categories

Relationship exploration between key variables

Aggregate insights suitable for dashboard presentation

## Usage Notes
This analysis is intended for educational and research purposes as part of data science learning exercises. The findings should be interpreted within the context of historical data analysis and machine learning practice.
